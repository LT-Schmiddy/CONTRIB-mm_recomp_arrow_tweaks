# MM Recompiled: Arrow Tweaks
This mod adds Arrow Cycling and Arrow Switching to Majora's Mask: Recompiled!

Explanation:
There are two config options: D-Pad Usage Mode and Arrow Cycling Mode.

D-Pad Usage Mode lets you choose whether you want to switch arrows via the D-Pad, or shoot them directly from the D-Pad as if it were a set of C-buttons.

Arrow Cycling mode lets you choose which button you want to cycle arrows with (L or R).

!! MAKE SURE YOU DISABLE THE BUILT-IN D-PAD MOD !!
